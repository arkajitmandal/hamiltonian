## Usage

* Download this folder and go view index.html or visit: https://codepen.io/arkajitmandal/full/MryaGa/

## Option

The options are straight forward. 
* Choose your Basis: Currently only two options available but can be easily expanded to include more basis
* Number of Basis Functions : Using More Basis will give you more eigen states with higher accuracy with lower speed.
* Number of Grid points : Integrations are done on grid points, therefore more grid points will give you higher accuracy with lower speed.
* V(x) : Potential energy function. Could be a constant or a function like,  "x^2 + sin(x) + cos(x)" 

It's as simple as that!
